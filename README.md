## Project Overview

This project presents an **interactive HR Analytics Dashboard** developed using **Microsoft Power BI** to support data-driven decision-making for HR managers.
The dashboard provides a consolidated view of **employee performance ratings, salary distribution, and workforce composition** across branches and product lines.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate how visual analytics can help HR teams:

* Monitor employee performance
* Understand salary allocation
* Identify workforce concentration across product categories
* Improve strategic workforce planning

---

## Business Problem

HR departments often struggle to quickly answer questions such as:

* Which branches perform better overall?
* How is salary expenditure distributed across branches?
* Which product lines employ the most people?
* Are salary levels consistent across product categories?

Raw HR data alone does not provide immediate insights. This dashboard converts complex datasets into **clear, actionable visuals** for faster and better HR decisions.

## Dashboard Objectives

* Analyze employee performance ratings by branch
* Evaluate salary distribution across branches
* Identify employee count by product line
* Compare average salaries across product categories
* Provide a single, interactive view for HR managers
